First Meeting:
    
    -Discussed Proposal, Algorithms, Traversals, etc.
    -Had Multiple Ideas but narrowed down towards using the flight data set
    -Decided to use BFS for traversal and Dijkstras and Kruskal’s for the graph algorithms
    -Dijkstras was going to be used to find the minimum distance between two airports that the user entered
    -Kruskal’s would be used to find how many airports a person could go in the world without being in a cycle

Second Meeting:
    
    -Formatted the airports and route dataset
    -Used the Graph files given and created psuedocode for BFS.cpp and created BFS.h
    -Created the airport class for all the airports, distances, etc.
    -Used the haversine function to calculate the distance between two airports

Third Meeting:
    
    -Created the MakeFile, and worked through all the compiler errors
    -Implemented a main function and created all the possible functions that we need to run in main
    -Created a basic testbench for BFS and planned our future tests for Dijkstras and Kruskals

Fourth Meeting:
    
    -Implemented Dijkstras and Kruskal Algorithms
    -Created Test Suites for the above algorithms and ensured it passed 
    -Combined all of function into the main function and ran the main command to ensure everything in our project works as mentioned
    -Debugged any last issues, created print statements, generated the video, and wrote up final documentation for submission
