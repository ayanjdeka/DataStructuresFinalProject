CS 225 Data Structures Team Contract (djadav2-ayand2-kavinsk2-paramum2)

Communication

1. **Team Meetings:** Our team will meet twice a week every Tuesday and Thursday from 10 PM to 11PM. We will begin our meetings with a summary of what we plan to do and end with what we finished and what is left to do, of which we will then split among each group member. There will be one team member designated each week to come up with this list of things to do and delegate tasks to each person for that week. This is to ensure that everyone has an equal amount of work to complete. If a member cannot make a meeting they must give a 24 hour notice so that the rest of the team can plan accordingly.

2. **Assistance:** Each team member can be contacted through Discord (Dharmil: aurumminer#5970, Param: bonobobeast#2613, Kavin: 30#9994, Ayan: ayanjdeka#3330). We will make sure that each person is accommodated for any special circumstances or emergencies.

3. **Respect:** As stated above, there will be one person assigned each week to manage and delegate tasks for that week, ensuring that every member is assigned equal work. They also are in charge of ensuring everyone’s voice is heard and allowing everyone to speak their opinions. By signing this document, everyone agrees to work together and help each other in order to finish the assignment.

Collaboration

1. **Work Distribution:** Each week, the necessary tasks for the week will be determined by the team as a whole during the first meeting of the week. We will make sure that all of the work determined to be done during that week is split evenly between every person. We will try to assign the specific parts of the work to each person’s strength.

2. **Time Commitment:** Apart from the team meetings, each member is expected to spend 3-4 hours on their own completing their task. If a task is taking too long to complete, it is the individual’s responsibility to ensure that they reach out for help and split up the work between all 4 members. If an individual has prior commitments, it is their responsibility to report the time conflict 24 hours ahead of time.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** If there are any conflicts within the group, we will ensure that we find a time where all members are free so we can meet and discuss the conflict. It is then our responsibility as a team to resolve the resolution amongst ourselves so that we can continue to make progress on the project. If a person does not finish their assigned work, it is their responsibility to spend more time the following week catching up to get on par with the other group members.
